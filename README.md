# CS_465-FullStack1

In our recent full-stack development project, we leveraged the power of Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, while Angular took center stage in our front-end development.
Node.js served as the core of our server, offering a seamless environment for handling requests and responses. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was selected for its adaptability
allowing us to efficiently manage various types of data. On the front end, Angular was instrumental in crafting a dynamic and responsive user interface,
elevating the user experience with its robust capabilities.

To ensure smooth communication between the front-end and back-end, we used JSON as our data format. JSON is a lightweight and human-readable language that helps maintain
consistency and efficiency across the entire system. Throughout the project, we continuously refined our application by restructuring our code and introducing reusable
user interface components. These components not only improved the development of our code but also enhanced the user experience. Our testing approach included API testing to verify
methods and comprehensive security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, resulting in a secure and efficient full-stack application that successfully
met our project objectives.
